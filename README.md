# Ethereum Voting

## Local development

### Install Ganache

Ganache is a local Ethereum blockchain implemented in JavaScript. You can download it [here](http://truffleframework.com/ganache) or the command line version [here](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache-cli).

### Install MetaMask

To connect to the Ethereum blockchain from your browser you will need to install the MetaMask extension which can be downloaded [here](https://metamask.io)

By default MetaMask will connect to the main Ethereum network. To connect to your local blockchain click on the MetaMask icon and then open the network drop-down in the top left corner and click "Custom RPC".
