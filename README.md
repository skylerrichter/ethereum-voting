# Ethereum Voting

## Local development

### Install Ganache

Ganache is a local Ethereum blockchain implemented in JavaScript. You can download it [here](http://truffleframework.com/ganache) or the command line version [here](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache-cli).

### Install MetaMask

To connect to the Ethereum blockchain from your browser you will need to install the MetaMask extension which can be found [here](https://metamask.io).

By default MetaMask will connect to the main Ethereum network. To connect to your local blockchain open MetaMask then open the network drop-down in the top left corner and click "Custom RPC" and enter the address to your local Ethereum blockchain found Ganache GUI (by default this is HTTP://127.0.0.1:7545).

Once you have connected to your local Ethereum blockchain open the accounts drop-down in the top left corner and click "Import Account" and paste the private key of the first Ethereum wallet found in the Ganache GUI.

NOTE: MetaMask caches response from the blockchain, if you restart the Ganache server you will either need to restart your browser or open the MetaMask settings in the top right corner, scroll down to the bottom and click "Reset Account".

### Install the Truffle CLI

```
$ npm install -g truffle
```

### Clone this repo

```
$ git clone git@github.com:skylerrichter/ethereum-voting.git
```

### Install dependencies

```
$ cd ethereum-voting
$ npm install
```

### Configure Truffle

If you have changed the hostname or port number in Ganache you will need to reflect these changes in the truffle.js file.

### Run migrations

Running migrations will deploy contracts to your local Ethereum blockchain and initialize them.

```
 $ truffle migrate
```

### Start Webpack

```
 $ npm run start
```
